						<h1>Hawaii Youth Pastor Internship</h1>
						<p>In early June of 2021 I was priveleged to serve as a Youth Pastor Intern with the Hawaii Conference. Not growing up as an Adventist, this endeavor has allowed me to gain some much-needed experience with practical hands-on experience.</p>

							<h2>Camp Waianae:</h2>
							<p>For the first month I was able to utilize my previous construction experience by daily helping with maintenance to prepare for the soon opening of Summer Camp. I did electrical work, yard work, small odds and ends, pool cleaning, and the list goes on. After prepping the ropes course I served as the ropes director through camp and assisted the cabin leader in caring for the kids.</p>

							<h2>Camp Waianae:</h2>
							<p>I was taken out of my comfort zone as we performed for the kids with daily songs and skits. The kids loved it and many of them made decisions for Christ.</p>

							<h2>Camp Waianae:</h2>
							<p>Since Summer camp has ended, there have been several occasions where I needed to return to the camp to assist with a major events and coordinating game for the kids.</p>

							<h2>Church:</h2>
							<p>There have been plenty of oppurtunities to preach at the Honolulu Japanese Seventh-day Adventist Church. Preaching both on the English speaking side, the Issei Japanese speaking side, and through online streaming during weeks when the church was closed due to high levels of Covid cases have all provided exciting oppurtunities to expand my skillsets in preaching.</p>

							<h2>Church:</h2>
							<p>We started with a small group, I called and texted each person, gave personal invites, announced it from the pulpit, and designed a flyer to promote in person meetings. The meetings were a hit and healthy communication has begun about the importance of faith in the church during these difficult times. One of which led to inviting Gary Parks to host a week long seminar over Emotional Intellegence and creating safe environments for conflict resolution within the church.</p>

							<h2>Church:</h2>
							<p>Working with the Senior Pastor and coordinating through participation in monthly board meetings, we have been able to make some much needed repairs and reorginazation of areas that were previously neglected. This includes remodeling and cleaning the Youth Room and making some repairs on the sanctuary walls.</p>

							<h2>Youth Pastor:</h2>
							<p>When I first arrived there were no meetings, no communication, and only 2 attending youth. We met with the Juniors leader, began a twice a month meeting schedule, and combined the groups until we could better strategize how to grow the group. Since then, the group has grown naturally and is thriving with almost over 10 kids on average each week.</p>

							<h2>Youth Pastor:</h2>
							<p>Church outdoors, Church at Camp, and Vespers are all events that I’m in charge of coordinating when appropriate. Now that the church is taking a turn towards a healthier outlook, we will begin outreach activities and fundraisers very soon.</p>

							<h2>Conference:</h2>
							<p>In addition to my usual church tasks, I am occasionally asked to fill in at other churches as a guest speaker. Other events have included me together with the other Interns who have performed four different Weeks of Prayer at four different schools on the island. We oversaw the entire program. I created a theme and wrote a skit that we performed with puppets. We had a theme song and performed music for the kids together.</p>

							<h2>Conference:</h2>
							<p>Whenever there is a major group event going on at another church, we all chip in to help cover what’s needed. Central Church hosted a lock-in for the students was an unforgettable experience for the students. </p>
