									<p>Early on in my decision to believe in God it became apparent that if I was in, I was all in. As I realized that God loves me, I was able to love God and others. In God's mercy I've marched forward in ignorance at times, but He has shown faithfulness to grow my character and see me through. Each transition in life has helped me to reflect on where God has taught me to love those who He has died for.</p>
									<p>As I’ve developed thousands of new relationships, I’ve noticed a universal ability to express emotion. In many territories where I have been unable to speak the native language, I have learned to listen to the full expression of both spoken and unspoken words. It has become apparent that people express similar emotions despite whichever language they may be speaking. One of the greatest languages spoken is the language of a smile. Sharing a smile together bonds us across the cultures of this world. This experience unites us and opens the door to share Jesus Christ.</p>
									<p>In of myself I am unable to accomplish greatness, but because Christ lives in me, and through Christ I can do all things, then there is nothing stopping God’s ability to perform miracles in and through me. For this reason, I give everything I do to the Lord, trusting that He is able to complete the work He has started.</p>
