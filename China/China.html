						<h1>China Highlights</h1>
						<p>I traveled to China as a tourist with the intentions of listening to God's leading. Not being a part of any denomination, I was able to learn quickly in how to survive as a self-sustaining servant of God.</p>

							<h2>Traveling through mainland China.</h2>
							<p>During this journey I learned about the many different religions of the world. I developed a passion for understanding the history of religion as I began to share the gospel. God granted me divine appointments that challenged my understanding while driving me to study the scriptures for myself.</p>

							<h2>My first time preaching was in Hong Kong.</h2>
							<p>It was here that God led me to become a Seventh-day Adventist. The calling for pastoral ministry was clear. After China I would enroll at Southwestern Adventist University for a bachelors in Theology.</p>

							<h2>A 27 hour train ride that opened my eyes.</h2>
							<p>As I was traveling I discovered creative ways to keep overhead costs down. I chose to live out of a backpack while learning to live off of the land. I learned the value of fellowship and the efforts it took to raise funding for the purpose of spreading the gospel.</p>

							<h2>Freindships that were made along the way that will never be forgotten.</h2>
							<p> Each person I came in contact with was an oppurtunity to learn and grow. I learned the value of community as I was being established with my trust in Christ.</p>
