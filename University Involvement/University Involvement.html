							<h2>Evangelism</h2>
							<p>As the nation was beginning to quarantine for the first wave of COVID 19, our Field Evangelism had to adapt to a changing ministry and quickly. Our class unified to arrange an online evangelistic series which has reached more people than we could have ever anticipated. We used, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube to host this 13-day series.</p>
